## Mood Classification

### Mood Categories & Scoring

| Mood      | Base Score | Description                         |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Happy     | 8          | Positive emotions, joy, contentment |
| Neutral   | 5          | Balanced, calm, stable state        |
| Sad       | 3          | Low mood, sadness, disappointment   |
| Anxious   | 4          | Worry, stress, nervousness          |
| Depressed | 2          | Hopelessness, emptiness, withdrawal |
| Angry     | 3          | Frustration, irritation, hostility  |

### Intensity Factors

The system considers:

- **Confidence**: Model prediction confidence
- **Emotional Words**: "very", "really", "extremely", etc.
- **Context**: Conversation flow and previous messages
- **Duration**: Session length and engagement

## Professional Mental Health Considerations

### Crisis Detection

The system identifies patterns that may require professional attention:

- Persistent low mood scores
- High mood volatility
- Declining engagement
- Specific crisis keywords

### Privacy & Ethics

- All mood data is stored securely
- Analysis is performed locally
- No sensitive data is shared externally
- Users maintain control over their data

### Limitations

- Not a replacement for professional mental health care
- Should be used as a supplement to therapy
- Crisis situations require immediate professional intervention
- Model accuracy depends on training data quality

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Model Performance

Monitor model accuracy:

```python
from chatbot.mood_analyzer import mood_analyzer
# Check model performance
accuracy = mood_analyzer.model.score(X_test, y_test)
```

### Data Quality

Regularly review:

- Mood classification accuracy
- User feedback on insights
- System recommendations effectiveness
- Engagement patterns

### Updates

- Retrain model with new data: `python manage.py train_mood_analyzer --force`
- Update training data in `mood_analyzer.py`
- Monitor for new mental health expressions
- Adjust scoring algorithms as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Not Loading**

   - Run: `python manage.py train_mood_analyzer`
   - Check file permissions in `chatbot/models/`

2. **Low Accuracy**

   - Retrain with more data: `python manage.py train_mood_analyzer --force`
   - Review training data quality
   - Adjust feature extraction parameters

3. **API Errors**
   - Check Django logs
   - Verify database migrations
   - Ensure all dependencies installed

### Performance Optimization

- Model is cached in memory after loading
- Database queries are optimized with select_related
- Progress calculations are batched
- API responses are cached where appropriate

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Advanced ML Models**

   - Transformer-based models for better context understanding
   - Multi-modal analysis (text + voice + video)
   - Real-time emotion detection

2. **Enhanced Analytics**

   - Predictive mood forecasting
   - Correlation with external factors (weather, events)
   - Personalized intervention recommendations

3. **Integration Features**

   - Wearable device integration
   - Calendar event correlation
   - Social support network analysis

4. **Professional Tools**
   - Therapist dashboard with patient insights
   - Automated progress reports
   - Crisis alert system

## Support

For technical support or questions about the mood tracking system:

- Check Django logs for detailed error messages
- Review the model training process
- Verify API endpoint configurations
- Test with sample data to isolate issues

The system is designed to be robust and self-healing, automatically falling back to keyword-based analysis if ML components fail.
